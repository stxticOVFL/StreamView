## Building & Contributing
This project uses Visual Studio 2022 as its project manager. When opening the Visual Studio solution, ensure your references are corrected by right clicking and selecting `Add Reference...` as shown below. 
Most will be in `Neon White_data/Managed`. Some will be in `MelonLoader/net35`, **not** `net6`. Select the `NeonLite` and `NeonNetwork` mods for those references. 
If you get any weird errors, try deleting the references and re-adding them manually.
